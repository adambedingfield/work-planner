 # About
Work Day Planner is a program that helps keep track your work day by creating a user editable agenda. The planner tracks the hours from 9AM-5PM allowing you to input tasks for each hour. Hours are labaled with grey being past hours, red being the current hour, and green being the future hours. Next to the time slot is a clickable text entry box allowing you to type in your task and a save button on the side to keep track of your changes. The page updates every 30 minutes to update the colors accordingly.
